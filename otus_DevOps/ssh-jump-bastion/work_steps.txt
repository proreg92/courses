Steps:

1) Connect to remote hots "instance-1' with Agent Forwarding RSA-key:
ssh -A user1@<IP_Address1> ssh user2@<IP_Address2>

2) Connect to remote host "instance-1" via host "bastion" with "-J" (jump host command):
ssh -J bastion instance

Create file 'config' in directory ~/.ssh/ and add to: 

Host bastion
     User user1
     HostName <ip-address1>
     Port 22
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host instance
     User user2
     HostName <ip-address2>
     Port 22
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     
3) Connect to remote host "instance-1" using aliases in 'config' file ~/.ssh/ and ProxyCommand:
ssh instance

Create file 'config' in directory ~/.ssh/ and add to: 

Host bastion
     User user1
     HostName <ip-address1>
     Port 22
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host instance
     User user1
     HostName <ip-address2>
     Port 22
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p bastion
